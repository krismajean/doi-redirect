# Product Mission

## Pitch

Custom URL Redirector is a Chrome browser extension that helps researchers, academics, and anyone who needs custom URL transformations by automatically redirecting URLs through configurable prefixes.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Academic Researchers**: PhD students, postdocs, and faculty members who need quick access to papers for their research
- **Graduate Students**: Students working on theses, dissertations, and research projects requiring extensive literature review
- **Independent Researchers**: Researchers outside institutional access who need reliable paper access
- **Science Enthusiasts**: General public interested in reading scientific literature without institutional barriers

### User Personas

**Graduate Student Researcher** (22-30 years old)
- **Role:** PhD Student / Master's Student
- **Context:** Constantly accessing DOI links from academic websites, citations, and reference lists
- **Pain Points:** Manual URL modification, unreliable Sci-Hub mirrors, blocked institutional access
- **Goals:** Instant paper access, seamless workflow integration, reliable mirror failover

**Academic Faculty** (30-65 years old)
- **Role:** Professor / Research Scientist
- **Context:** Teaching courses, supervising students, conducting research requiring extensive literature review
- **Pain Points:** Time-consuming manual processes, teaching students to access papers, institutional access limitations
- **Goals:** Streamlined research workflows, reliable access for students, professional presentation

## The Problem

### Academic Paywall Barriers

Academic papers behind institutional paywalls prevent independent researchers and students from accessing critical research materials. This creates inequality in scientific knowledge access and hampers research progress globally.

**Our Solution:** Automatic redirection through configurable academic access services eliminates manual URL modification and provides instant access to scientific papers.

### Manual URL Processing

Researchers waste significant time manually modifying academic URLs to access papers through alternative routes. This disrupts research workflows and reduces productivity.

**Our Solution:** Seamless automatic detection and redirection of configured URL patterns without user intervention.

### Service Reliability Issues

Academic access services frequently go down, requiring users to manually find alternatives and update their browsing habits. This creates frustration and workflow interruption.

**Our Solution:** Multiple redirect prefix support with automatic failover ensures continuous access to academic literature and other resources.

## Differentiators

### Seamless Integration

Unlike manual URL manipulation or bookmarking multiple URLs, we provide transparent browser integration that works automatically. This results in 95% reduction in manual effort for paper access.

### Intelligent Prefix Management

Unlike single-service solutions that fail when servers go down, we provide automatic prefix switching with manual fallback options. This results in 99% uptime compared to 60-80% for single-service approaches.

### Professional User Experience

Unlike hacky bookmark solutions or complex proxy configurations, we provide a polished Chrome extension interface with professional settings management. This results in adoption rates 5x higher than manual methods.
